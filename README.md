# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Python (EDA) and Power BI (dashboarding). 
The goal is to understand customer behavior and identify factors influencing churn to help improve retention strategies.

## Objectives
- Understand churn distribution across demographics and service types.
- Identify key drivers of churn (e.g., contract type, internet service).
- Visualize trends using Power BI for business decision-making.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Performed in Jupyter Notebook using:
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Key steps:
- Data cleaning and type conversions
- Missing value handling
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Feature-wise churn comparison

## Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- KPIs: Total Customers, Churn Rate, Average Charges
- Line Chart: Churn Trend by Tenure
- Bar Charts: Churn by Senior Citizen & Contract
- Pie & Donut Charts: Churn Distribution by Gender

## Key Insights
- **Month-to-Month contracts** show the highest churn.
- **Fiber Optic users** churn more than DSL users.
- **Senior Citizens** have slightly higher churn tendency.
- Customers with **longer tenure** are less likely to churn.
